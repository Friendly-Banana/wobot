### Running the Bot

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. [Install Shuttle](https://docs.shuttle.dev/getting-started/installation)
3. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (or use
   your [local PostgresQL](https://docs.shuttle.dev/docs/local-run#local-runs-with-databases))
4. Create a Discord Bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
5. Copy the bot token and put it in a `Secrets.toml` file in the root directory:
    ```toml
    DISCORD_TOKEN = "<your token>"
    ```
6. Invite the bot to your server with all permissions you need (`ADMINISTRATOR` is the easiest).
7. Run the bot with `shuttle run`

## Technical Overview

WoBot is a Discord Bot written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
with [the  Poise framework](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise/).
It's hosted on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/) and uses a PostgresQL database.

The mensa plan uses the [Eat API](https://tum-dev.github.io/eat-api), the mensa coordinates link
to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

The [Mensaplan API](https://github.com/Friendly-Banana/mensaplan) is written by myself in Elixir.

### Configuration

`config.hjson` uses a human-friendly JSON version, [HJson](https://hjson.github.io/).

You can set up automatic reactions and replies based on keywords. All of them are case-insensitive.
Auto-reactions match only on word boundaries, ignoring punctuation around them.
For example, `wobot` would match `WoBot!` but not `wo bot`.
WoBot can react with both Unicode and custom Discord emojis, even animated ones.

#### Example Config

```json
// channel for event threads
event_channel_per_guild: {
  // guild_id: channel_id
  1: 1
},
auto_reactions: {
  robot: {
    name: "ðŸ¤–"
  }
  vibing: {
    animated: true
    name: vibing
    // emoji id
    id: 1
  }
},
auto_replies: [
  {
    keywords: [
      "wobot info"
      "wobot help"
    ]
    // discord user id
    user: 1
