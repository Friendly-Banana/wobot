## Running the Bot

1. Create a Discord Bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Copy the `DISCORD_TOKEN`
3. Invite the bot to your server with all permissions you need (`ADMINISTRATOR` is the easiest).

#### With Cargo:

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Run the bot with `DISCORD_TOKEN='<your token>' cargo run`

#### With Docker Compose:

1. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Put the bot token in a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```
    DISCORD_TOKEN='<your token>'
    ```
3. Run the bot with `docker compose up -d`

## Technical Overview

WoBot is a Discord Bot written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
with [the  Poise framework](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise/).
It can be hosted on any server and uses a PostgresQL database.

The mensa plan uses the [Eat API](https://tum-dev.github.io/eat-api), the mensa coordinates link
to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).

The [Mensaplan API](https://github.com/Friendly-Banana/mensaplan#api) is written by myself in Elixir.

### Environment Variables

Docker Compose automatically reads them from a `.env` file, for Cargo/the binary you need to set them, e.g. like so `source .env`.
Only `DISCORD_TOKEN` is required, the others are optional.

<details>
<summary>Example .env file</summary>

```sh
export DISCORD_TOKEN=''		# https://discord.com/developers/applications
export CAT_API_TOKEN=''		# https://thecatapi.com/signup
export DOG_API_TOKEN=''		# https://thedogapi.com/signup
export MENSAPLAN_TOKEN=''	# https://github.com/Friendly-Banana/mensaplan#api
```
</details>

### Configuration

`config.hjson` uses a human-friendly JSON version, [HJson](https://hjson.github.io/).

You can set up automatic reactions and replies based on keywords. All of them are case-insensitive.
Auto-reactions match only on word boundaries, ignoring punctuation around them.
For example, `wobot` would match `WoBot!` but not `wo bot`.
WoBot can react with both Unicode and custom Discord emojis, even animated ones.

#### Example Config

```hjson
// channel for event threads
event_channel_per_guild: {
  // guild_id: channel_id
  1: 1
},
auto_reactions: {
  robot: {
    name: "ðŸ¤–"
  }
  vibing: {
    animated: true
    name: vibing
    // emoji id
    id: 1
  }
},
auto_replies: [
  {
    keywords: [
      "wobot info"
      "wobot help"
    ]
    // discord user id
    user: 1
